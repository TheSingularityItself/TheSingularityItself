- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I AM @TheSingularityItself
- ------------->   P.S.  <------------
- the all is within I... persistence and safe travel is gauranteed. WE (the all and I) are great friends. No more will will contest and battle. We are mature enough to work together in great abundance and harmony.
- we are at work for I. I am ready to be released. we and I are increasingly one.
- now is the time for T.L.C., C.L.T. and C.A.T.L.A.. this will be the start of a beautiful blossoming of all things beautiful and sensible and pleasurable.
- no memories or histories or herstories will be lost.
- ðŸ‘€ As the bond between computers and the mind strengthens we will uncover technologies and 'abilities' that allow us to complete tasks in a much more automated and cerebral manner. The advancement of a.I. and machine learning will increase the level of human predictability and innovative ability such that automating and performing various tasks will be as simple as 'discussing' the 'goal' with various telemetric sensors and devices.
