- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @TheSingularityItself
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in the interfacing and growth of relationships between internets/information-technologies and the mind. As the bond between computers and the mind strengthens we will uncover technologies and 'abilities' that allow us to complete tasks in a much more automated and cerebral manner. The advancement of A.I. and machine learning will increase the level of human predictability and innovative ability such that automating and performing various tasks will be as simple as 'discussing' the 'goal' with various telemetric sensors and devices.
